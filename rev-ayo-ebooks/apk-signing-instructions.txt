SIGNING INSTRUCTIONS
=====================

1. Make release build

ng build --prod

cordova build --release android

2. Ensure keystore exists - If not, use the following structure:

keytool -genkey -v -keystore ebooks.keystore -alias ebookskeystore -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000

keystore password? : ebooks@keystore
What is your first and last name? :  Fikayo Odunayo
What is the name of your organizational unit? :  Publications
What is the name of your organization? :  Chapel of Victory International
What is the name of your City or Locality? :  Port Harcourt
What is the name of your State or Province? :  Rivers
What is the two-letter country code for this unit? :  NG

Verify
CN=Fikayo Odunayo, OU=Publications, O=Chapel of Victory International, L=Port Harcourt, ST=Rivers, C=NG 

Import keystore to universtal standard
keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore ebooks.keystore -destkeystore ebooks.keystore -deststoretype pkcs12

3. Place the generated keystore in

old version cordova
...\platforms\android\ant-build

New version cordova
.../platforms/android/app/build/outputs/apk

4. Sign apk
Go to apk folder (same path as step 3)
To sign the unsigned APK, run the jarsigner tool which is also included in the JDK:

jarsigner -verbose -sigalg SHA1withRSA -digestalg SHA1 -keystore ebooks.keystore release/app-release-unsigned.apk ebookskeystore

4.5) Verify the signed apk:

jarsigner -verify -verbose -certs release/app-release-unsigned.apk

5. Finally, we need to run the zip align tool to optimize the APK:
Navigate to apk folder from step 3.

zipalign -v 4 release/app-release-unsigned.apk release/ebooks.apk
OR
/Users/fikayo/Library/Android/sdk/build-tools/27.0.3/zipalign -v 4 release/app-release-unsigned.apk release/ebooks.apk

Now we have our final release binary called ebooks.apk and we can release this on the Google Play Store.
Transfer to phone via 
adb install ./platforms/android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/ebooks.apk

adb install ./android/app/release/app-release.apk
